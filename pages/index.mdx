Hello, I'm a Technology Professional with over 30 years experience in software engineering.  I've worked for fortune 500 companies as well as startups.

I enjoy leading engineering and product teams to deliver world class solutions; all while evangelizing emerging technologies and processes to accelerate productivity and increase satisfaction.

Most recently I served as a Director of Software Engineering at Optum, leading a team of UX, Software, and Data Engineers to build out prototypes and to champion design thinking and agile culture.
